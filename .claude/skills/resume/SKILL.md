# /resume

Reconstruct full session context from the state file and filesystem. Output a structured handoff report so work can resume without relying on chat history.

## What to do

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any step.

### Step 1 — Find the state file

- Glob `state_*.md` in the project root
- If no state file found: stop and tell the user the project has not been initialized — they should run `/new-workflow` first
- If multiple state files found: list them and ask the user which one to load
- Read the full contents of the state file

### Step 2 — Read the workflow definition

- List files in `workflows/`
- If a workflow `.md` file exists, read it in full
- If no file exists, note this — the plan phase has not been completed yet

### Step 3 — Inspect the filesystem

Collect the following without making assumptions:

- `nodes/` — list all scripts that exist
- `tests/` — list all test files that exist
- `outputs/` — list all output files that exist (evidence of successful runs)
- `.tmp/` — list any intermediate files present (evidence of an in-progress or interrupted run)
- Project root — check for `orchestrator.*`, `run.*`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `.env`, `.gitignore`

### Step 4 — Cross-check state vs filesystem

Compare what the state file claims against what actually exists on disk. Flag each discrepancy explicitly:

- State says nodes are implemented → do those files exist in `nodes/`?
- State says tests are written → do corresponding files exist in `tests/`?
- State says orchestrator is implemented → does `orchestrator.*` exist in the root?
- State says the workflow ran successfully → does `outputs/` contain files?
- State says deployed → do `run.*` and `.env.example` exist?

### Step 5 — Determine the current phase

Based on state file content and filesystem evidence, identify which phase the project is in:

| Evidence | Phase | Next command |
|---|---|---|
| No state file | Not started | `/new-workflow` |
| State file exists, no workflow plan | Initialized | `/plan` |
| Workflow plan exists, no nodes in `nodes/` | Planned | `/develop` |
| Nodes exist, no files in `outputs/` | Developed | `/run-workflow` |
| Files in `outputs/`, no `run.*` entrypoint | Run successful | `/deploy` |
| `run.*` entrypoint exists | Deployed | Workflow complete |

If discrepancies exist between the state file and the filesystem, flag the phase as **inconsistent** and describe what needs to be reconciled before proceeding.

### Step 6 — Present the session summary

Output exactly this structure:

---
**PROJECT**: <project name from state file>

**OBJECTIVE**: <objective from state file>

**PHASE**: <current phase>

**COMPLETED**:
<bulleted list of what is verifiably done — cross-referenced with filesystem, not just state file claims>

**CURRENT STATUS**:
<verbatim or paraphrased from the "Current Status" field of the state file>

**DISCREPANCIES** *(omit section if none)*:
<bulleted list of state claims that don't match the filesystem>

**KNOWN ISSUES** *(omit section if none)*:
<from the "Known Issues" field of the state file>

**NEXT STEP**: Run `/<command>` — <one sentence explaining why this is the right next action>
---

After presenting the summary, stop. Do not proceed to execute the next step unless the user explicitly instructs you to.
